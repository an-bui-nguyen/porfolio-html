<h3>Ratatouille (2007)</h3>
<p>This is a movie about a rat that wants to cook in Paris. Amazing movie, I cry everytime.</p>
<h3>Pretty Woman (1990)</h3>
<p>Just a fun rom-com that has the right amount of sardonism and optimism that I like. Also it has Julia Roberts.</p>

<h3>God's Own Country (2017)</h3>
<p>Debut movie by Francis Lee. A heartfelt exploration of existentialism and love in the barren Ireland.</p>
